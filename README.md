# LARC_Incidence_MScan
This code was used for the study Busse et al. 2023 (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37823033/) to describe trends in new LARC insertion incidence using raw claims data from Merative's MarketScan Commercial Encounters and Claims Database.

Files are provided for deriving the cohort and analyzing the data.

- The RMD file demonstrates how figures were generated with the summary data sets.
- The numbered files were used to either derive the population cohorts or run the analyses. The numbers correspond to the order in which they should be run.
- All other files are macros that are used throughout the rest of the programs.

Data are accessible after payment to Merative with an appropriate data use agreement. All analyses were approved by UNC's Institutional Review Board. No data are uploaded to this repository.
